# chapter 1 Notes
- Introduction Notes from "The Self-Taught Programmer"
- "Most good programmers do programming not because the expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program."
- Software Engineer II --> Above an entry level software engineer, but below a senior software engineer.
- This book was written specifically for those looking to program professionally. --> Whether your goal is to becomae a software engineer, an entrepreneur or to use your new programming skills in another profession.

# How the book is structured
- The book is divided into six parts:
    1. Learning to program
    2. Learning Object-Orientated Programming (OOP)
    3. Learning to use programs (like you Operating Systems) that will make you a better programmer
    4. Learning Computer Science
    5. Learning to program for production
    6. Getting a job and working on a team

- Many of the subjects covered in a single chapter of this book could be, and are, covered by entire books. The goal is not to cover every detail of every subject, moreso just to give you a map or an outline of all the skills you need to develop in order to program professionally.

- PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING --> You will write your first program as quickly as possible.
- PART 2: INTRODUCTION TO OOP --> The book covers different programming paradigms (focussing OOP) and building a game that will show you the power of programming.
- PART 3: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING TOOLS --> You learn to use different programming tools to take your programming productivity to the next level. - By this point you're hooked on programming and want to get even better. - You'll learn even more about your OS, how to collaborate with other engineers using version control, how to use your IDE to boost your productivity and how to install and manage other people's programs.
- PART 4: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE --> Now that you can program, you'll have all kinds of questions about how everthing works. This section is where a lot of those questions get answered. -  I cover algorithms and data structures, network programming and computer architecture.
- PART 5: PROGRAMMING FOR PRODUCTION --> You will learn to program for production (create code that is actually used by other people). - I cover the software development process, testing and best programming practices.
- PART 6: LAND A JOB. --> The final section is about getting a job as a software engineer, working on a team and improving as a programmer. - I provide tips on how to pass a technical interview, work on a team as well as advice on how to improve your skills.
- If you don't have any programming experience, you should try to practice programming on your own as much as possible between each section.
- `Don't try to read this book too quickly. Instead, use it as a guide and practice for as long as you need in between sections.`

# Endgame First
- The way I learned to program is the opposite of CS is usually taught, and I structured the book to follow this approach. --> Tradiotionally, you spend alot of time learning theory; so much so, that many CS graduates come out of school not knowing how to program.
- So instead of learning the opening moves, I focus on learning the endgame (where there are only a few piceces left on the board) first. --> This gives me a better understanding of the game, and will increase my chance of winning and becoming a champion.
- `While theory is important, it will be even more valuable once you have the skills and experience.`

# The Self-taught Advantage
- A 2015 Stack Overflow survey found 48 percent of respondents didn't have a CS degree.
- As intimidating as it might be to work with people who have bachelors, masters, and PHDs in CS, never forget that you have the "Self-Taught Advantage". --> Wanting to learn is the biggest advantage you can have in this industry.

# Why You Should Program
- Learning to prpogram is empowering. --> I love coming up with new ideas, and I always have a new project that I want to work on.
- Once I learned how to program, I could sit down and build my ideas without needing to find someone to do it for me.
- There aren't many subjects that don't benefit from finely tuned problem-solving skills.
- Learning to program will free you from repetivive tasks forever.
- Evening if your goal isn't to become a software engineer, jobs in fields like science and finance are beginning to favor candidates with programming experience.

# Sticking With It
- If you don't have any programming experience and are nervous about making this journey, I want you to know you're absolutey capable of doing it. --> There are some common misconceptions about programmers like they're all really good at math. This isn't true, but it is hard work.
- `In order to improve your programming skills you should practice programming every day. `
