# What is Cybersecurity?
- Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems (like servers, software, mobile devices, networks, and data that cotain sensitive information) from cyber attacks.
- Cybersecurity or IT security measures are designed to protect against threats from both inside and outside of an organization. Simply put, cybersecurity is used by organizations and enterprises for protecting computer systems and data centers from unauthorized access.

# Some of the main domians that Cybersecurity measures should adress are as follows:
- `Network Security` --> Security practices to protect network accessible resources and prevent unauthorized access.
- `Cloud Security` --> Encrypting cloud data in storage, transfer, and processing to support regulatory compliance, business requirments, and customer privacy.
- `Application Security` --> Implementing security practices at the time of application design and development while keeping user authentication and data handling in mind.
- `Critical Infrastructure Security` --> It's a US security program that ensure the security of interconnected systems, assets, and netowrks that are necessary for public safety, national security, and economic safety.
- `End-User Security` --> Implementing multi-layered, end-to-end security solutions such as web security, email security, firewalls, and endpoint security for end-user safety.
- `Disaster Recovery` --> The process of maintaining an organiztiona's infrastucture and systems so that they can be restored in the event of power outages, natural disasters, or cybersecurity with minimal disruptions.
- `Information security` --> Enforcing GDPR (General Data Protection Regugulations) in the application program to secure unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
- `Storage Security` --> It's the process of securing data storage ecosystems along with the stored data by offering strong data resilience via encrypting and isolating data copies to avoid cyber attacks.
- `Mobile Security` --> These are the cybersecurity measures that protect sensitive data stored on mobile devices like smart phones, laptops, wearables, voices assistants, etc.
