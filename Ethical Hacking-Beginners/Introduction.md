# What is Cybersecurity?
- Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems (like servers, software, mobile devices, networks, and data that cotain sensitive information) from cyber attacks.
- Cybersecurity or IT security measures are designed to protect against threats from both inside and outside of an organization. Simply put, cybersecurity is used by organizations and enterprises for protecting computer systems and data centers from unauthorized access.

# Some of the main domians that Cybersecurity measures should adress are as follows:
- `Network Security` --> Security practices to protect network accessible resources and prevent unauthorized access.
- `Cloud Security` --> Encrypting cloud data in storage, transfer, and processing to support regulatory compliance, business requirments, and customer privacy.
- `Application Security` --> Implementing security practices at the time of application design and development while keeping user authentication and data handling in mind.
- `Critical Infrastructure Security` --> It's a US security program that ensure the security of interconnected systems, assets, and netowrks that are necessary for public safety, national security, and economic safety.
- `End-User Security` --> Implementing multi-layered, end-to-end security solutions such as web security, email security, firewalls, and endpoint security for end-user safety.
- `Disaster Recovery` --> The process of maintaining an organiztiona's infrastucture and systems so that they can be restored in the event of power outages, natural disasters, or cybersecurity with minimal disruptions.
- `Information security` --> Enforcing GDPR (General Data Protection Regugulations) in the application program to secure unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
- `Storage Security` --> It's the process of securing data storage ecosystems along with the stored data by offering strong data resilience via encrypting and isolating data copies to avoid cyber attacks.
- `Mobile Security` --> These are the cybersecurity measures that protect sensitive data stored on mobile devices like smart phones, laptops, wearables, voices assistants, etc.

# Common Cyber Threats
- `Phishing` --> Phishing is one of the social Engineering attcatks where cyber attackers aim to steal your identity or money by using psychological manipulation to trick you into revealing you sensitive or Personal Identifiable Information. - In simple terms, they will send you an email or message pretending to be a legitimate company (asking for login credentials, bank account details, or credit card data).
- `Malware` --> It reers to malicious software programs (viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, ransomare, botnets and adware) that are intended to cause harm or disruption to the computer networks, systems, servers, etc. to gain unauthorized access to the information. - Typical malware is spread and installed on the user's computer via genuine-looking downloads or email attachments.
- `SQL Injection` --> It is a form of cyber attack where malicious SQL code is injected into an application to give hackers control over its DB (database) and gain access to sensitive information stored there.
- `Man-In-The-Middle` --> It's an eavesdropping cyberattack in which a cyber attacker secretly sends and alters commutincation between two individuals to gain private information while they believe the are communicating with one another.
- `Brute Force` --> This attack involves the use of a trial and error method to guess every possible password combination to crack login credentials, passwords, and encryption keys.
- `DNS Attacks` --> Denial-of-Servics attacks that target the availability of network resources and make the temporarily unavailable, disrupting host services. - It prevents the computer network or system from functioning properly and fulfilling user requests.
- `Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)` --> It's a form of cyber threat where the attacker disrupts the traffic of the targeted server by overwhelming it, by send a flod of internet traffic at once.
- `Crptojacking` --> In cyberjacking/ cryptojacking, attackers hijack the computer system for mining crptocurrencies against the will of the user.
- `Social Engineering` --> It's a psychological manipulation technique used by cyberattackers to trick people into making security mistakes leading to revealing their confidential data. - Pretexting, Phishing, Tailgating, and CEO fraud are some examples
